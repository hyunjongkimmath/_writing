In manifold theory, there are many notions describable or definable via $C^k$, i.e. $k$-differentiability. In the case of $k = 0$, the adjective/adverb of $C^0$ is omitted. In the case of $k = \infty$, one can synonymously describe that notion as ``smooth'' or simply ``differentiable''. In other cases, one can say ``$k$-differentiable'' instead of ``$C^k$''. For example, a $C^0$\hyperrefIfExists{definition:C_k_manifold}{-manifold} is simply a \hyperrefIfExists{definition:topological_manifold}{(real) topological manifold}, a $k$-differentiable manifold refers to a $C^k$-manifold, and a smooth/differentiable (real) manifold refers to a $C^\infty$-manifold.
