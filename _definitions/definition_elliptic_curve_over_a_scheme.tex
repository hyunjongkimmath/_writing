\begin{definition}[Elliptic curve over a scheme] \label{definition:elliptic_curve_over_a_scheme}
Let $S$ be a scheme. An \hldef{elliptic curve over $S$} is a pair $(E, \pi)$ where
\begin{itemize}
    \item $E$ is a scheme together with a morphism $\pi: E \to S$,
    \item $(E, \pi)$ is an abelian scheme of relative dimension $1$ over $S$, i.e. $\pi$ is proper, smooth, of relative dimension $1$, with geometrically connected fibers, and 
    \item a chosen section $e: S \to E$, called the \hldef{zero section}, endowing $(E, \pi)$ with the structure of a commutative group scheme over $S$.
\end{itemize}
Equivalently, an elliptic curve over $S$ is a smooth proper curve of genus $1$ over $S$ together with a marked $S$-point that plays the role of the identity.
