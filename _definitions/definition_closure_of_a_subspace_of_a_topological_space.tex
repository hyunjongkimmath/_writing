\begin{definition}[Closure of a subset] \label{definition:closure_of_a_subspace_of_a_topological_space}
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space and $A \subseteq X$ a subset. The \hldef{closure of $A$ in $X$}, denoted by \hl{$\overline{A}$}, is defined as the intersection of all closed sets containing $A$, i.e.,
\[
\overline{A} \;:=\; \bigcap \{ C \subseteq X : C \text{ is closed and } A \subseteq C \}.
\]
Equivalently, $\overline{A}$ is the smallest closed set containing $A$.
