\begin{definition}[Complex Algebraic Variety]
A \hldef{complex algebraic variety} \(X\) is a topological space equipped with a sheaf of complex-valued regular functions \(\mathcal{O}_X\), such that every point \(x \in X\) admits an open neighborhood \(U \subseteq X\) for which \((U, \mathcal{O}_X|_U)\) is isomorphic to an \hldef{affine algebraic variety}, i.e., the zero locus of finitely many polynomial equations in some \(\mathbb{C}^n\):
\[
U \cong V(I) = \{ z \in \mathbb{C}^n \mid f(z) = 0 \text{ for all } f \in I \}
\]
where \(I \subseteq \mathbb{C}[x_1, \dots, x_n]\) is a radical ideal.
