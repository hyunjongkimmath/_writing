\begin{definition}[Quasi-separated morphism of schemes] \label{definition:quasi_separated_morphism_of_schemes}
    Let $f : X \to Y$ be a \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:morphism_of_schemes}{morphism of schemes}.

    \TODO{closed immersion}
        The morphism $f$ is \hldef{quasi-separated} (resp. \hldef{separated}) if the \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:diagonal_morphism_of_a_morphism_of_schemes}{diagonal morphism}
        \[
        \Delta_f : X \to X \times_Y X
        \]
        is \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:quasi_compact_morphism_of_schemes}{quasi-compact} (resp. a closed immersion). In this case, we can also say that $X$ is a \hldef{quasi-separated $Y$-scheme} or a \hldef{quasi-separated scheme over $Y$}. A \hldef{quasi-separated scheme} refers to a quasi-separated scheme over \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:affine_scheme}{$\Spec \bbZ$}. 

        % That s, the fiber product $X \times_Y X$ is such that the morphism $\Delta_f$ has the property that the inverse image of any affine quasi-compact subset of $X \times_Y X$ is quasi-compact in $X$.

        Intuitively, $f$ is quasi-separated if the intersection of two affine open subsets in $X$ which map into an affine open of $Y$ can be covered by finitely many affine opens.
