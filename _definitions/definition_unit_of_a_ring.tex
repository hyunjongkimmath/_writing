\begin{definition} \label{definition:unit_of_a_ring}
    Let $(R,+,\cdot)$ be a \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:ring}{not-necessarily commutative ring}. A \hldef{unit} or \hldef{invertible element of $R$} is an element $u \in R$ such that there exist an element $v \in R$ such that 
    $$uv = 1 = vu.$$ 
    Such an element $v$ is called the \hldef{multiplicative inverse of $u$} and is often denoted by \hl{$u^{-1}$}. If it exists, then it is unique.
    
    The set of units of $R$ forms a \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:group}{group}, often denoted by \hl{$R^\times$} or \hl{$R^*$}, under the multiplication operation $\cdot$. It is called the \hldef{group of units} or \hldef{unit group} of $R$.
