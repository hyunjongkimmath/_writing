\begin{definition} \label{definition:irreducible_topological_space}
Let $X$ be a \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:topological_space}{topological space}. The space $X$ is said to be an \hldef{irreducible topological space} if $X$ is non-empty and cannot be expressed as the union of two proper closed subsets. That is, if $X = Z_1 \cup Z_2$ with $Z_1, Z_2$ closed in $X$, then either $Z_1 = X$ or $Z_2 = X$. Equivalently, $X$ is irreducible if every non-empty open subset of $X$ is dense in $X$.
