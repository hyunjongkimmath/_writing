\begin{definition} \label{definition:transitive_set}
A set $x$ is a \hldef{transitive set} if every element of $x$ is also a subset of $x$. Formally, $x$ is transitive if for all $y \in x$, the condition $y \subseteq x$ holds, which is equivalent to the statement that for all $z \in y$, it follows that $z \in x$.
