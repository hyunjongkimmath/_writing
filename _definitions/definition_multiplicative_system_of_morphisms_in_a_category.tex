    \TODO{Write a precise definition}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category. A \hldef{multiplicative system $S$ in $\mathcal{C}$} consists of a collection of morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$ satisfying:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $S$ contains all identity morphisms,
    \item $S$ is closed under composition,
    \item (Ore conditions) For any morphism $f$ in $\mathcal{C}$ and any morphism $s \in S$ with suitable domain and codomain, there exist morphisms to form commutative squares allowing localization.
\end{itemize}
The precise Ore condition varies depending on context but guarantees the localization exists.
\end{definition}
