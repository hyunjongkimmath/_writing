\begin{definition} \label{definition:jacobson_radical_of_a_ring}
Let $R$ be a \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:ring}{ring}, not assumed commutative.  
The \hldef{Jacobson radical of $R$}, denoted by \hl{$J(R)$}, 
is the intersection of all maximal left ideals of $R$:
$$J(R) = \bigcap \{ M \subseteq R : M \text{ is a maximal left ideal of } R \}.$$
Equivalently, $J(R)$ is also the intersection of all maximal right ideals of $R$. Thus, $J(R)$ is a two-sided ideal of $R$.
