\begin{definition}[Subset] \label{definition:subset_of_a_set}
Let $A$ and $B$ be sets.
The set $A$ is said to be a \hldef{subset of $B$}, written as \hl{$A \subseteq B$} or \hl{$A \subset B$}, if every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$, that is,
$$ A \subseteq B \iff \forall x \,(x \in A \Rightarrow x \in B).  $$
If $A \subseteq B$ and $A \ne B$, then $A$ is called a \hldef{proper subset of $B$}; this is commonly denoted by \hl{$A \subsetneq B$}.
