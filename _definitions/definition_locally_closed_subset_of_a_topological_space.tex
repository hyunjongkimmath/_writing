\begin{definition} \label{definition:locally_closed_subset_of_a_topological_space}
    Let $X$ be a \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:topological_space}{topological space}. A subset $Z \subseteq X$ is called a \hldef{locally closed subset} if $Z$ can be written as the intersection $U \cap C$, where $U$ is an open subset of $X$ and $C$ is a closed subset of $X$. Equivalently, $Z$ is a locally closed subset if it is an open subset of its closure $\overline{Z}$ endowed with the \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:subspace_of_a_topological_space}{subspace topology}.
