\begin{definition}[Compact topological space] \label{definition:compact_topological_space}
A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is \hldef{compact} if every open cover of $X$ admits a finite subcover; that is, for every collection $\{ U_i \}_{i \in I}$ of open sets in $\mathcal{T}$ such that $X = \bigcup_{i \in I} U_i$, there exists a finite subcollection $\{ U_{i_j} \}_{j=1}^n$ such that $X = \bigcup_{j=1}^n U_{i_j}$.

Some mathematicians, e.g. algebraic geometers, would refer to this property as \hldef{quasi-compactness}.
