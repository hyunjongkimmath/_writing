\begin{definition} \label{definition:C_k_map_between_open_subsets_of_closed_half_spaces_of_Rns}

    Let $U \subseteq \mathbb{H}^n$ and $V \subseteq \mathbb{H}^m$ be open subsets of the closed half-spaces 
    $\mathbb{H}^n = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n : x_n \geq 0 \}$ and $\mathbb{H}^m = \{ y \in \mathbb{R}^m : y_m \geq 0 \}$ respectively, 
    and let $k \in \mathbb{N}_0 \cup \{\infty\}$ be fixed.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A \hldef{$C^k$-morphism} (or \hldef{$C^k$-map}) from $U$ to $V$ is a function $f : U \to V$
        such that $f$ extends to a $k$-times continuously differentiable function on an open neighborhood of $U$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
        Equivalently, all partial derivatives
        $$ D^\alpha f : U \to \mathbb{R}^m, \quad |\alpha| \leq k, $$ 
        exist and are continuous up to the boundary on $U$.
        We denote the set of all such maps by \hl{$C^k(U, V)$}.

        \item A \hldef{$C^k$-function on $U$} is a $C^k$-map from $U$ to $\bbR$. We let \hl{$C^k(U)$} denote the space of $C^k$-functions on $U$.

        \item A \hldef{$C^k$-diffeomorphism} $f: U \to V$ is a $C^k$-morphism that is a bijection whose inverse $f^{-1}$ is also a $C^k$-morphism between open subsets of half-spaces.

        \item A \hldef{smooth morphism/map/function/diffeomorphism} is one that is $C^\infty$ in the above sense.
    \end{enumerate}
    In fact, when $U$ and $V$ are open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ without boundary points, the notions of $C^k$-morphisms coincide with the classical ones of $k$-times continuously differentiable maps between open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$. In this case, the extension condition is trivially satisfied by restricting to an open neighborhood in $\mathbb{R}^n$. For open subsets with boundary points in $\mathbb{H}^n$, the extension requirement ensures differentiability up to the boundary.

    % In fact, we may discuss all of these notions in the case that $U$ and $V$ are open subsets of $\bbR^n$ by identifying $U$ and $V$ with open subsets of $\bbH^n$ and $\bbH^m$ contained entirely in the \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:interior_and_boundary_of_topological_space}{interiors} of $\bbH^n$ and $\bbH^m$ via a diffeomorphism \TODO{state a statement for this.} Moreover, a function $f: U \to V$ for such $U$ and $V$ is a $C^k$-morphism if $f$ itself is $k$-times continuous differentiable, without the need to refer to an extension of $f$.
