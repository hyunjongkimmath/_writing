\begin{definition}[Polynomial ring over a commutative ring] \label{definition:polynomial_ring_over_a_commutative_ring}
    Let $R$ be a \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:commutative_ring}{commutative ring}. For a set of variables $\{x_i\}_{i \in I}$, the \hldef{polynomial ring in variables $\{x_i\}$ over $R$}, denoted by notations such as \hl{$R[x_i \mid i \in I]$} or \hl{$R[x_i]_{i \in }$}, is defined as the commutative \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:algebra_of_a_ring}{$R$-algebra} whose elements are finite $R$-linear combinations of monomials in the variables $x_i$, where the variables commute with each other and with elements of $R$.

    That is, $R[x_i \mid i \in I]$ is the free commutative $R$-algebra generated by the set $\{x_i\}$. 
    
    In the case that $I$ is a finite set, and writing $y_1,\ldots,y_n$ for the variables $x_i$, it is customary to let \hl{$R[y_1,\ldots,y_n]$} denote the polynomial ring.
