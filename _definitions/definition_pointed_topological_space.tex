\begin{definition}[Pointed topological space] \label{definition:pointed_topological_space}
Let $X$ be a \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:topological_space}{topological space} and let $x_0 \in X$ be a chosen element of $X$.  
A \hldef{pointed/based (topological) space} is a pair $(X, x_0)$ consisting of the space $X$ together with the distinguished point $x_0$, called the \hldef{base point of $X$}. If the base point of a pointed space $(X,x_0)$ is understood, then it may be suppressed from notation; in particular, $X$ may be written as a pointed space as opposed to the full notation of $(X,x_0)$. 

A \hldef{morphism of pointed spaces} (or \hldef{based map}) or \hldef{continuous map} between pointed spaces $(X, x_0)$ and $(Y, y_0)$ is a \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:continuous_map_of_topological_spaces}{continuous map} 
$$f : X \to Y$$ 
such that $f(x_0) = y_0$.

The collection of pointed spaces with their morphisms form a \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:locally_small_category}{locally small} \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:category}{category}, often called the \hldef{category of pointed spaces}. This category is often denoted by notations such as \hl{$\mathrm{Top}_*$}, \hl{$\mathrm{Top}_\bullet$}, \hl{$\mathbf{Top}_*$}, \hl{$\mathbf{Top}_\bullet$}, etc. The set of continuous maps from pointed spaces $X$ to $Y$ may denoted by notations such as \hl{$C_*(X,Y)$}, \hl{$C_\bullet(X,Y)$}, \hl{$\mathrm{Top}_*(X,Y)$}, \hl{$\mathrm{Top}_\bullet(X,Y)$}, \hl{$\Hom_{\mathrm{Top}_\bullet}(X,Y)$}, etc.
