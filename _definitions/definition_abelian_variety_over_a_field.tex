\begin{definition}[Abelian variety over a field] \label{definition:abelian_variety_over_a_field}
    Let $k$ be a field. An \hldef{abelian variety over $k$} is a complete, connected algebraic group variety defined over $k$, i.e.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $A$ is a smooth, proper, geometrically connected algebraic variety over $k$,
        \item $A$ is endowed with a group structure defined by morphisms of varieties over $k$ (multiplication $m: A \times_k A \to A$ and inverse $i: A \to A$),
        \item the group law satisfies the group axioms scheme-theoretically.
    \end{itemize}
    In particular, an abelian variety is a projective \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:algebraic_group_scheme_over_a_scheme}{algebraic group variety} over $k$.
