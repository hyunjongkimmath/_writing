\begin{definition} \label{definition:universally_closed_morphism_of_schemes}
A \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:morphism_of_schemes}{morphism of schemes} $f: X \to Y$ is said to be \hldef{universally closed} if it is a \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:open_and_closed_map_of_topological_spaces}{closed map} of topological spaces, and for every morphism $Y' \to Y$, the \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:base_change_of_a_morphism_in_a_category_by_a_morphism}{base} change $f': X \times_Y Y' \to Y'$ is also a closed map. That is, for any scheme $Y'$ over $Y$, the image of any closed subset of $X \times_Y Y'$ under the projection to $Y'$ is closed in $Y'$.
