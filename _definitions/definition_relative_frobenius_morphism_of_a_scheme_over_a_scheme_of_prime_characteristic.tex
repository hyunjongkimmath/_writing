\begin{definition} \label{definition:relative_frobenius_morphism_of_a_scheme_over_a_scheme_of_prime_characteristic}
    Let $S$ be a scheme of prime characteristic $p$. Let $X$ be an $S$-scheme and let $\varphi: X \to S$ be a structure morphism. Let $n \in \bbZ$.
    The \hldef{relative $p^n$th power Frobenius morphism of $X/S$} is the morphism
    $$(F_{X,p^n}, \varphi): X \to  X \times_S S_{F,p^n} = X^{(p^n)/S}$$
    where
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $X^{(p^n)/S}$ denotes the \hyperrefIfExists{definition:extension_of_scalars_of_a_scheme_of_prime_characteristic_by_frobenius}{extension of scalars of $X/S$ by the $p^n$th power Frobenius}\CrefIfExists{definition:extension_of_scalars_of_a_scheme_of_prime_characteristic_by_frobenius}
        \item $S_{F,p^n}$ denotes the \hyperrefIfExists{definition:restriction_of_scalars_by_Frobenius_for_a_scheme}{restriction of scalars of $S$} (as an $S$-scheme)\CrefIfExists{definition:restriction_of_scalars_by_Frobenius_for_a_scheme}, and 
        \item $\varphi$ is regarded as a morphism $X \to S_{F,p^n}$ by regarding $S_{F,p^n}$ as a copy of $S$. 
    \end{itemize}
    The relative Frobenius morphism above may commonly be denoted by notations such as \hl{$F_{X/S, p^n}$}, \hl{$F_{X|S, p^n}$}, \hl{$Frob_{X/S, p^n}$}, and \hl{$Frob_{X|S, p^n}$}. For $n < 0$, note that this definition is only well defined under the assumption that $F_{S,p^{|n|}}$ is invertible. 


    In the case that $n = 1$, this is referred to as the \hldef{relative Frobenius morphism of $X/S$} and may commonly be denoted by notations such as \hl{$F_{X/S}$}, \hl{$F_{X|S}$}, \hl{$Frob_{X/S}$}, and \hl{$Frob_{X|S}$}.
