\begin{definition} \label{definition:successor_ordinal_of_an_ordinal}
Let $\alpha$ be an \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:ordinal_number}{ordinal number}. The ordinal number $\alpha$ is called a \hldef{successor ordinal} if there exists an ordinal $\beta$ such that $\alpha = \beta \cup \{\beta\}$. In this case, $\alpha$ is the \hldef{immediate successor of $\beta$} and is denoted by \hl{$\beta + 1$}.
