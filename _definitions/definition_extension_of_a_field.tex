\begin{definition}[Field Extension] \label{definition:extension_of_a_field}
Let $K$ be a field and let $L$ be a field such that $K \subseteq L$ and the operations of $K$ are the restrictions of those of $L$.  
Then $L$ is called a \hldef{extension field (or just an extension) of $K$}. The notation \hl{$L/K$} is often used synonymously; we say that $L/K$ is a \hldef{field extension}. Moreover, $K$ is said to be a \hldef{subfield of $L$}.
