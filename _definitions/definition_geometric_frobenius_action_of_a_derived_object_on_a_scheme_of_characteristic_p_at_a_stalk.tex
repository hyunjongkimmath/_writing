\begin{definition} \label{definition:geometric_frobenius_action_of_a_derived_object_on_a_scheme_of_characteristic_p_at_a_stalk}
    Let $X$ be a scheme of characteristic $p$. Let $x \in |X|$ be a closed point whose residue field is a finite field. Let $\barx$ be a geometric point over $X$. Let $K \in D(X)$ be an object in the derived category of sheaves of abelian groups on $X$. 
 %Let $n \geq 1$ be an integer.
    
    The \hyperrefIfExists{definition:arithmetic_and_geometric_frobenius_automorphisms_of_algebraic_extensions_of_finite_fields}{geometric Frobenius automorphism} in $\Gal(\overline{\kappa(x)} / \kappa(x))$ can be identified as an automorphism 
    $$\Spec \overline{\kappa(x)} \to \Spec \overline{\kappa(x)}$$
    over $\Spec \kappa(x)$ and hence induces an action 
    $$\hlin{\Frob_{\barx}: K_{\barx} \to K_{\barx}}$$
    on the stalk. Up to isomorphism this action only depends on the closed point $x$ and not the choice of the geometric point $\barx$ above $x$.

    This automorphism may be called the \hldef{geometric Frobenius action on $K$ at the stalk at $\barx$}. In case that the size of the residue field $\kappa(x)$ is $q$ (or is considered as $q$, say by virtue of changing the base field over which $X$ is defined) we may also denote the geometric Frobenius action using notations such as \hl{$\Frob_{\barx, q}$} or \hl{$\Frob_{q}$} to emphasize the size of $\kappa(x)$.
