\begin{definition} \label{definition:countable_finite_uncountable_sets}
Let $A$ be a set.
\begin{itemize}
  \item The set $A$ is said to be \hldef{countably infinite} (or simply \hldef{countable}) if there exists a bijection $f : \mathbb{N} \to A$.
  \item The set $A$ is said to be \hldef{finite} if there exists some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and a bijection $g : \{1,2,\dots,n\} \to A$.
  \item The set $A$ is said to be \hldef{at most countable} if it is either finite or countably infinite.
  \item The set $A$ is said to be \hldef{uncountable} if it is not at most countable.
\end{itemize}
