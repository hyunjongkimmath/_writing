\begin{definition}[Free associative algebra over a ring] \label{definition:free_associative_algebra_over_a_ring}
    Let $R$ be a \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:ring}{(not necessarily commutative) ring}, and let $\{x_i\}_{i\in I}$ be a set of formal variables indexed by a set $I$.

    The \hldef{free associative $R$-algebra on the variables $\{x_i\}_{i \in I}$}, denoted by notations such as \hl{$R\langle x_i \mid i \in I \rangle$} or \hl{$R\langle x_i  \rangle_{i \in I}$}, is defined as the \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:algebra_of_a_ring}{$R$-algebra} whose underlying $R$-module is freely generated by all finite words in the letters $x_i$ (including the empty word, which acts as the multiplicative unit), with multiplication given by concatenation of words extended $R$-linearly.

    Equivalently, $R\langle x_i \mid i \in I \rangle$ is the noncommutative polynomial ring generated by the $x_i$ over $R$, satisfying no relations other than those required by the ring and algebra axioms.

    In the case that $I$ is a finite set, and writing $y_1,\ldots,y_n$ for the variables $x_i$, it is customary to let \hl{$R\langle y_1,\ldots,y_n \rangle$} denote the free associative $R$-algebra.
