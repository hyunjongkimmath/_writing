\begin{definition}[Local System of \(\Lambda\)-Modules on a Topological Space]
Let \(X\) be a topological space and \(\Lambda\) a ring (commutative with unity, typically). 

A \hldef{local system of $\Lambda$-modules} on \(X\) is locally constant sheaf of $\Lambda$-modules.

% a sheaf \(\mathcal{L}\) of \(\Lambda\)-modules such that for every point \(x \in X\), there exists an open neighborhood \(U \subseteq X\) of \(x\) and a \(\Lambda\)-module \(L\) such that

% \[ \mathcal{L}|_U \cong \underline{L}, \]

% where \(\underline{L}\) is the constant sheaf on \(U\) associated to the \(\Lambda\)-module \(L\).

% Typically, one assumes \(L\) is finitely generated projective over \(\Lambda\) to ensure good properties.
