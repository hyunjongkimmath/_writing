    \TODO{TODO: define kernel,image of a group homomorphism of algebraic groups, }
    Let $S$ be a scheme and let $f: G \to H$ be a \hyperrefIfExists{definition:algebraic_group_scheme_over_a_scheme}{homomorphism} of \hyperrefIfExists{definition:algebraic_group_scheme_over_a_scheme}{$S$-algebraic groups}. 

    There are related, but conflicting definitions for what it means for $f$ to be an \hldef{isogeny of $S$-algebraic groups}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item We commonly say that $f$ is an isogeny of algebraic groups if it is surjective and its kernel $\ker f$ is a finite flat group scheme over $S$.
        \item Inequivalently, we might alternatively say that $f$ is an isogeny of algebraic groups if $\ker f$ is a finite flat group scheme over $S$ and its image has finite index in $H$.
    \end{enumerate}
    Unless otherwise specified, the first definition will generally be used.
\end{definition}
