    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over an algebraically closed field $k$. A \hldef{Borel subgroup} $B \subseteq G$ is a maximal connected closed solvable subgroup of $G$. Equivalently, a Borel subgroup is a minimal parabolic subgroup of $G$.

        \item Let $G \to S$ be a connected \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:reductive_linear_algebraic_group_over_a_scheme}{reductive group scheme} over a base scheme $S$. 
        A \hldef{Borel subgroup scheme of $G$} is a closed subgroup scheme $B \subseteq G$ such that:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $B \to S$ is smooth and affine,
            \item for every geometric point $s \to S$, the fiber $B_s \subseteq G_s$ 
            is connected and is a Borel subgroup of the connected reductive algebraic group $G_s$.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    One also says \hldef{maximal Borel subgroup} to emphasize the maximality.
