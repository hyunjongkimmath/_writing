\begin{definition} \label{definition:galois_morphism_of_schemes}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f: X \to Y$ over $S$ be a \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:finite_morphism_of_schemes}{finite morphism}. It is called \hldef{Galois} (or synonymously a \hldef{Galois cover/Galois covering}) if there exists a finite group $G$ acting on $X$ over $Y$ such that
\begin{itemize}
  \item $f$ is identified with the quotient map $X \to X/G$. 
  \item the group action realizes $Y$ as the categorical quotient under the group action.
\end{itemize}
If $f$ is Galois, then the finite group $G$ is isomorphic to the \hyperrefIfExists{definition:automorphism_group_of_a_scheme_over_a_scheme}{automorphism group $\Aut_Y(X)$}. By a \hldef{Galois $G$-cover/morphism}, we mean a Galois morphism whose automorphism group is (isomorphic to) $G$, often equipped with a fixed isomorphism $\phi: G \to \Aut_Y(X)$. 

% If $f$ is Galois and \hyperrefIfExists{definition:etale_morphism_of_schemes}{\'etale}, then we say that $f$ is a \hldef{finite Galois covering} or that $X$ is a \hldef{finite Galois cover of $Y$}.

In case $f$ is an \'etale morphism, then $f$ is equivalently Galois if there exists a finite group $G$ acting on $X$ over $Y$ such that 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $f$ is identified with the quotient map $X \to X/G$. 
    \item $G$ acts simply transitively on geometric fibres.
\end{itemize}
% Equivalently, $f$ is a Galois covering with Galois group $G$.
