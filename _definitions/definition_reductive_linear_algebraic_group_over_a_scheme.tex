\begin{definition}[Reductive group] \label{definition:reductive_linear_algebraic_group_over_a_scheme}
Let $G$ be a \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:linear_algebraic_group_over_a_scheme}{linear algebraic group} that is smooth, finitely presented, and with connected geometric fibers over a scheme $S$.
\begin{itemize}
    % \item The \hldef{unipotent radical of $G$}, denoted \hl{$\mathrm{Rad}_u(G)$}, is the largest smooth connected normal unipotent subgroup of $G$.
    \item In the case that $S$ is $\Spec k$ for a field $k$, the group $G$ is called \hldef{reductive} if $\mathrm{Rad}_u(G)$ is trivial, i.e. $\mathrm{Rad}_u(G) = \{e\}$, and $G$ is smooth, connected, and affine over $S$.
    \item For general $S$, the group $G$ is called \hldef{reductive} if it is a smooth affine group scheme $G/S$ whose geometric fibers are connected reductive algebraic groups.
\end{itemize}
