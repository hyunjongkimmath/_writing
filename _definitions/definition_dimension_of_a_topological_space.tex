\begin{definition} \label{definition:dimension_of_a_topological_space}
Let $X$ be a \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:topological_space}{topological space}. The \hldef{dimension of $X$} or \hldef{Krull dimension of $X$}, denoted by \hl{$\dim(X)$}, is the supremum of the lengths of strictly ascending chains of distinct \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:irreducible_topological_space}{irreducible} closed subsets of $X$. That is, $\dim(X)$ is the supremum of integers $n$ such that there exists a chain
$$Z_0 \subsetneq Z_1 \subsetneq \dots \subsetneq Z_n$$
where each $Z_i$ is a non-empty irreducible closed subset of $X$. If $X$ is empty, its dimension is defined to be $-\infty$ (or sometimes $-1$).
