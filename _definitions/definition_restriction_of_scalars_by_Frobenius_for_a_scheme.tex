\begin{definition} \label{definition:restriction_of_scalars_by_Frobenius_for_a_scheme}
    Let $S$ be a scheme of prime characteristic $p$. Let $X$ be an $S$-scheme and say that $\varphi: X \to S$ is the structure morphism. Let $n \in \bbZ$.

    The \hldef{restriction of scalars for $X/S$ by $p^n$th power Frobenius} is the $S$-scheme denoted commonly by notations such as \hl{$X/S_{F, p^n}$}, \hl{$X/S_{\Frob, p^n}$} or \hl{$X_{F, p^n}$}, \hl{$X_{\Frob, p^n}$} if the base scheme $S$ is clear, whose underlying scheme is $X$ and whose structure morphism is given by the composition
    $$X \xrightarrow{\varphi} S \xrightarrow{F_{S,p^n}}S$$
    where \hyperrefIfExists{definition:absolute_frobenius_morphism_on_a_scheme}{$F_{S,p^n}$} is the \hyperrefIfExists{definition:absolute_frobenius_morphism_on_a_scheme}{$p^n$th absolute Frobenius morphism on $S$}\CrefIfExists{definition:absolute_frobenius_morphism_on_a_scheme}. For $n < 0$, note that this definition is only well defined under the assumption that $F_{S,p^{|n|}}$ is invertible.  In the case that $n = 1$, this is referred to as the \hldef{restriction of scalars for $X$ by Frobenius} and commonly denoted by notations such as \hl{$X_F$} and \hl{$X_{\Frob}$}.
