\begin{definition}[Locally Noetherian Scheme and Noetherian Scheme] \label{definition:locally_noetherian_and_noetherian_scheme}
Let $X$ be a \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:scheme}{scheme}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item $X$ is called \hldef{locally Noetherian} if it admits an open cover $\{U_i\}$ such that for each $i$, the ring $\mathcal{O}_X(U_i)$ of regular functions on $U_i$ is a \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:noetherian_ring}{Noetherian ring}. Equivalently, $X$ is locally Noetherian if it is covered by open affine subschemes $\Spec A_i$ with each $A_i$ a Noetherian ring.

    \item $X$ is called \hldef{Noetherian} if it is locally Noetherian and \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:quasi_compact_scheme}{quasi-compact}, i.e., $X$ can be covered by finitely many affine opens $\Spec A_i$ where each $A_i$ is Noetherian.
