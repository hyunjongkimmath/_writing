\begin{definition}[Connected topological space] \label{definition:connected_topological_space}
    Let $X$ be a \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:topological_space}{topological space}.
    The space $X$ is called a \hldef{connected topological space}, or simply \hldef{connected}, if it cannot be written as a disjoint union $X = U \sqcup V$ of two nonempty open subsets $U,V \subseteq X$.
    Equivalently, $X$ is connected if the only subsets of $X$ that are both open and closed are $\varnothing$ and $X$ itself.
