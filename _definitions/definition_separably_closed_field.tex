\begin{definition}\label{definition:separably_closed_field}
A field $F$ is said to be \hldef{separably closed} if every nonconstant separable polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$ has a root in $F$, i.e., for every such $f(x)$ there exists $a \in F$ with $f(a) = 0$ (equivalently, every separable polynomial factors completely into linear factors over $F$).
