\begin{definition} \label{definition:restricted_product_of_a_family_of_sets_with_respect_to_a_family_of_distinguished_subsets}
Let $\{X_i\}_{i \in I}$ be a family of sets indexed by a set $I$. For each $i \in I$, let $K_i \subseteq X_i$ be a distinguished subset of $X_i$.

The \hldef{restricted product of the family $\{X_i\}_{i \in I}$ with respect to the subsets $\{K_i\}_{i \in I}$}, denoted 
$$\hlin{\prod_{i \in I}' X_i},$$
is the subset of the full direct product
$$ \prod_{i \in I} X_i $$
consisting of all elements $(x_i)_{i \in I}$ such that $x_i \in K_i$ for all but finitely many $i \in I$.
