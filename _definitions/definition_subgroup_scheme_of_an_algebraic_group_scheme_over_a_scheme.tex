\begin{definition} \label{definition:subgroup_scheme_of_an_algebraic_group_scheme_over_a_scheme}
Let $S$ be a scheme, and let $G$ be an algebraic group scheme over $S$. A \hldef{subgroup scheme} (or synonymously an \hldef{algebraic subgroup}) $H$ of $G$ is an $S$-subscheme
$$ H \subseteq G $$
such that for every $S$-scheme $T$, the subset $H(T) \subseteq G(T)$ is a subgroup of the group $G(T)$. Equivalently, $H$ is a group object in the category of $S$-schemes equipped with a monomorphism of group schemes $H \to G$.
