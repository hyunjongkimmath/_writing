    \TODO{I think that the definition of derived categories might be doable for more general kinds of resolutions? Perhaps it is that if I have a right exact functor $F$, then $L^i F$ can be computed with resolutions of $F$-acyclic objects? \CrefIfExists{definition:F_acyclic_object_for_a_left_or_right_functor_between_abelian_categories}}
    \TODO{Apparently, left/right derived functors may be defined for functors that are additive and preserve finite coproducts, and not necessarily right/left exact; the exactness condition ensures that the zeroth derived functor agrees with $F$.}
Let $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ be \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:abelian_category}{abelian categories}, and let 
$$F: \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B}$$ 
be an \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:additive_functor_between_additive_categories}{additive functor}.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Suppose that the functor $F$ is \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:exact_functor_between_abelian_categories}{right exact} and suppose that $A \in \calA$ is an object for which a \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:left_right_resolution_of_a_class_of_objects_in_an_abelian_category}{projective resolution}
    $$\cdots \to P_2 \to P_1 \to P_0 \to A \to 0$$
    exists in $\calA$. We define the \hldef{left derived object} \hl{$L_n F A \in \calB$} by applying $F$ to obtain a complex
    $$\cdots \to F(P_2) \to F(P_1) \to F(P_0) \to 0$$
    and letting $L_n F(A)$ be the \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:homology_and_cohomology_objects_for_a_chain_complex_in_an_additive_category}{$n$-th homology object} of this complex in $\mathcal{B}$:
    $$L_n F(A) := H_n(F(P_\bullet)).$$
    The object $L_n F(A)$ is independent of the choice of projective resolution up to natural isomorphism (\Cref{proposition:left_right_derived_objects_for_a_right_left_exact_functor_between_abelian_categories_are_well_defined}). 

    By convention, set $L_n F = 0$ for $n < 0$.

    The \hldef{higher left derived objects} refer to the object $L_n F(A)$ for $n > 0$. 

    \item  Suppose that the functor $F$ is \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:exact_functor_between_abelian_categories}{right exact} and that $\calA$ \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:has_enough_injectives_or_projectives_for_an_abelian_category}{has enough projectives}.

    and letting $R_n F(A)$ be the \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:homology_and_cohomology_objects_for_a_chain_complex_in_an_additive_category}{$n$-th cohomology object} of this complex in $\mathcal{B}$:
    $$R_n F(A) := H^n(F(I_\bullet)).$$
    The object $R_n F(A)$ is independent of the choice of injective resolution up to natural isomorphism (\Cref{proposition:left_right_derived_objects_for_a_right_left_exact_functor_between_abelian_categories_are_well_defined}). 

    By convention, set $R_n F = 0$ for $n < 0$.

    The \hldef{higher right derived objects} refer to the object $R_n F(A)$ for $n > 0$. 

    \item  Suppose that the functor $F$ is \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:exact_functor_between_abelian_categories}{right exact} and that $\calA$ \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:has_enough_injectives_or_projectives_for_an_abelian_category}{has enough injectives}.

    The right derived functors are also often denoted by \hl{$R^n F$}.
