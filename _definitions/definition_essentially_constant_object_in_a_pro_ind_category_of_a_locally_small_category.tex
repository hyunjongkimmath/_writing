\begin{definition} \label{definition:essentially_constant_object_in_a_pro_ind_category_of_a_locally_small_category}
Let $\mathscr{C}$ be a \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{lemma:category_of_presheaves_on_a_small_category_of_locally_small_value_is_locally_small}{locally small category}. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item An \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:ind_pro_category_of_a_locally_small_category}{Ind-object} $X = \varinjlim X_i$ is said to be \hldef{essentially constant} if it is isomorphic in $\text{Ind}(\mathscr{C})$ to an object in the image of the canonical fully faithful functor $h: \mathscr{C} \to \text{Ind}(\mathscr{C})$, which maps an object $A \in \text{ob}(\mathscr{C})$ to the Ind-object represented by the constant diagram.

    \item A \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:ind_pro_category_of_a_locally_small_category}{Pro-object} $X = \varprojlim X_i$ is said to be \hldef{essentially constant} if it is isomorphic in $\text{Pro}(\mathscr{C})$ to an object in the image of the canonical fully faithful functor $h: \mathscr{C} \to \text{Pro}(\mathscr{C})$, which maps an object $A \in \text{ob}(\mathscr{C})$ to the Pro-object represented by the constant diagram.
\end{enumerate}
In either definition, the object $A$ may be referred to as the \hldef{value/limit/constant value of the Ind/Pro object} or the \hldef{object representing the Ind/Pro object}.
