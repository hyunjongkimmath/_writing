\begin{definition} \label{definition:C_k_manifold}
Let $k \in \mathbb{N}_0 \cup \{\infty\}$ be fixed. An \hldef{$n$-dimensional $C^k$/$k$-differentiable-(real)manifold with boundary (resp. without boundary)} is a pair $(M, \mathcal{A})$, where $M$ is a \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:topological_manifold}{topological manifold with boundary (resp. without boundary)} of dimension $n$ and $\mathcal{A}$ is a \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:C_k_atlas_on_a_topological_manifold}{$C^k$-atlas} on $M$.

The atlas $\mathcal{A}$ is usually taken to be \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:atlas_on_a_topological_manifold}{maximal} with respect to \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:C_k_compatible_charts_on_a_topological_manifold}{$C^k$-compatibility}, meaning it contains every $C^k$-chart compatible with all charts in $\mathcal{A}$.

Note that a $C^0$-manifold is simply a \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:topological_manifold}{topological manifold} and that a $C^\infty$-manifold is synonymously referred to as a \hldef{smooth/differentiable (real) manifold}.
