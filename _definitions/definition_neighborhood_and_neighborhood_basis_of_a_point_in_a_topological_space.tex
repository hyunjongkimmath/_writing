\begin{definition} \label{definition:neighborhood_and_neighborhood_basis_of_a_point_in_a_topological_space}
Let $(X,\mathcal{T})$ be a \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:topological_space}{topological space} and let $x \in X$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item An \hldef{open neighborhood of $x$} is any open set $U \in \mathcal{T}$ such that $x \in U$.
    \item A \hldef{neighborhood of $x$} is a set $N \subseteq X$ for which there exists an \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:open_neighborhood_of_a_point_of_a_topological_space}{open neighborhood $U \in \mathcal{T}$} of $x$ such that $U \subseteq N$.
    \item A \hldef{neighborhood basis} (or \hldef{local base}) at $x$ is a nonempty collection $\mathcal{B}_x$ of neighborhoods of $x$ such that for every neighborhood $N$ of $x$, there exists $B \in \mathcal{B}_x$ with $B \subseteq N$.

    The elements of $\mathcal{B}_x$ are said to \hldef{form a base of neighborhoods} at $x$.
