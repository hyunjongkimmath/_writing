    Let \((X, \mathcal{A}, \mu)\) be a measure space and \(1 \leq p \leq \infty\). 
    %Since $L^p(X, \mu)$ is a (complete) measure space with respect to the measure induced by the $L^p$-norm, we may speak of convergence and  
    
    A sequence of measurable functions \(\{f_n\}_{n=1}^\infty\), where each \(f_n : X \to \mathbb{R}\) (or \(f_n : X \to \mathbb{C}\)), \hldef{converges to a function $f: X \to \mathbb{R}$ (or $f: X \to \mathbb{C}$) in the $L^p$ norm} if and only if the sequence $(f_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ converges to $f$ in the sense of (see Definition \ref{definition:convergence_and_limits_in_extended_metric_space}) the extended metric space which (see Remark \ref{remark:space_of_measurable_functions_is_an_extended_metric_space_for_any_Lp_metric}) is the space of all measurable functions equipped with the metric induced by the $L^p$ norm, i.e. 

    \[ \lim_{n \to \infty} \|f_n - f\|_p = 0. \]

    We may thus also say that $f$ is the \hldef{limit of $(f_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ for the $L^p$ norm on $X$}, and write 
    $$\hlin{f = \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n \text{ in } L^p}$$
    or 
    $$\hlin{f_n \to f \text{ in } L^p}.$$
