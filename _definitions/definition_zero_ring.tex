    Any set with a single element equipped with the only possible binary operators $+$ and $\cdot$ is a \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:commutative_ring}{commutative ring} whose multiplicative and identity elements are both the sole element. Any ring with a single element is called the \hldef{zero ring} or the \hldef{trivial ring}.
