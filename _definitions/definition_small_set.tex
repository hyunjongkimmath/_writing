\begin{definition}[Small Set] \label{definition:small_set}
    A \hldef{small set} refers to a set; the adjective of \emph{small} is used to emphasize that the set is a set, rather than a proper class.

    Alternatively, a \hldef{small set} is any object that belongs to a fixed universe of sets $\mathcal{U}$, called the \hldef{universe of small sets}.  
    In other words, a set $A$ is said to be \hldef{small} if and only if $A \in \mathcal{U}$.  
    Elements of $\mathcal{U}$ may themselves be sets, but $\mathcal{U}$ is not assumed to be a set; it may be a proper class.
