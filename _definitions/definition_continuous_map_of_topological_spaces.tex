\begin{definition} \label{definition:continuous_map_of_topological_spaces}
Let $(X,\mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y,\mathcal{T}_Y)$ be \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:topological_space}{topological spaces}. A map $f : X \to Y$ is called \hldef{continuous} if for every open set $V \in \mathcal{T}_Y$, the preimage $f^{-1}(V)$ is an open set in $X$, that is,
$$\hlin{\forall V \in \mathcal{T}_Y, \; f^{-1}(V) \in \mathcal{T}_X.}$$
Equivalently, $f$ is continuous if and only if for every closed set $C \subseteq Y$, the preimage $f^{-1}(C)$ is closed in $X$. 


A \hldef{map of topological spaces} usually refers to a continuous map between the topological spaces.

The set of continuous maps from $X$ to $Y$ is sometimes denoted by \hl{$C(X,Y)$}. Other standard notation include \hl{$\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathrm{Top}}(X,Y)$} or \hl{$\operatorname{Top}(X,Y)$} coming from more general notation for morphisms between objects in a \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:category}{category}.

% The collection of topological spaces along with continuous maps form a \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:locally_small_category}{locally small} \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:category}{category}, usually called the \hldef{category of topological spaces} and often denoted by notations such as $\mathrm{Top}$, $\mathbf{Top}$, etc. 

% The set of continuous maps from $X$ to $Y$ is sometimes denoted by \hl{$C(X,Y)$}. Other standard notation include \hl{$\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathrm{Top}}(X,Y)$} or \hl{$\operatorname{Top}(X,Y)$} coming from more general notation for morphisms between objects in a category.
