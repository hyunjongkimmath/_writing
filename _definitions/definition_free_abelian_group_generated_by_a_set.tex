\begin{definition} \label{definition:free_abelian_group_generated_by_a_set}
Let $S$ be a set. The \hldef{free abelian group generated by $S$} is the abelian group consisting of all formal linear combinations of elements of $S$ with integer coefficients, such that only finitely many coefficients are nonzero.
This group is denoted by
\hl{$\mathbb{Z}[S]$}
or alternatively as the direct sum
$$\hlin{\mathbb{Z}^{(S)} := \bigoplus_{s \in S} \mathbb{Z} s}$$
It satisfies the universal property that for any abelian group $A$ and any function $f: S \to A$, there exists a unique group homomorphism $\psi: \mathbb{Z}[S] \to A$ extending $f$.
