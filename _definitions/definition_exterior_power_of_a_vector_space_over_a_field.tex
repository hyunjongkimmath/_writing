% \begin{definition} \label{definition:vector_bundle}
% Let $M$ be a topological manifold and $E$ be a \hldef{real vector bundle} of rank $r$ over $M$. This means $E$ is a topological space together with a continuous surjection $\pi : E \to M$ such that for every point $p \in M$, the fiber
% $$
% E_p := \pi^{-1}(\{p\})
% $$
% has the structure of a real vector space of dimension $r$, and there exists an open neighborhood $U$ of $p$ in $M$ with a homeomorphism (local trivialization)
% $$
% \Phi_U : \pi^{-1}(U) \to U \times \mathbb{R}^r
% $$
% which restricts on each fiber to a linear isomorphism $E_q \to \{q\} \times \mathbb{R}^r$ for $q \in U$.

% The space $E$ is called the \hldef{total space} of the vector bundle, $M$ the \hldef{base space}, and $\pi : E \to M$ the \hldef{bundle projection}.

\begin{definition} \label{definition:kth_exterior_power_of_vector_space_over_a_field}
Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space over a field $\mathbf{F}$ with dimension $r$, and let $k \in \{0,1,\ldots,r\}$. The \hldef{$k$th exterior power of $V$}, denoted by \hl{$\bigwedge^k V$}, is defined as the vector space over $\mathbf{F}$ generated by formal antisymmetric $k$-linear combinations of elements of $V$. Equivalently, it is the quotient of the $k$-fold tensor product $V^{\otimes k}$ by the subspace generated by all elements that violate antisymmetry.

In particular, $\bigwedge^0 V$ is defined as $\mathbf{F}$, and $\bigwedge^1 V = V$.
