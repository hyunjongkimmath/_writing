\begin{definition}[Analytification of a Complex Algebraic Variety]
Let \( X \) be a complex algebraic variety defined over \(\mathbb{C}\). The \hldef{analytification of $X$}, denoted \hl{$X^{\mathrm{an}}$}, is the complex analytic space constructed as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item As a set, \( X^{\mathrm{an}} \) is the set of complex points of \( X \), that is,
    \[
    X^{\mathrm{an}} := X(\mathbb{C}) = \{ x : \operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{C} \to X \}.
    \]

    \item The space \( X^{\mathrm{an}} \) is endowed with the \hldef{complex analytic topology} induced from the classical complex topology on \(\mathbb{C}^n\) via local embeddings of \( X \) into affine space.

    \item The \hldef{structure sheaf} \hl{$\mathcal{O}_{X^{\mathrm{an}}}$} is defined by sheafifying the rings of holomorphic functions on open subsets of \( X^{\mathrm{an}} \) that locally correspond to holomorphic functions on analytic neighborhoods in \(\mathbb{C}^n\) vanishing on the equations defining \( X \).
\end{enumerate}
This construction defines a functor
\[
(-)^{\mathrm{an}} : \{\text{Complex algebraic varieties}\} \to \{\text{Complex analytic spaces}\}.
\]
