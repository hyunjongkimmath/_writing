\begin{definition}[Real and complex numbers as complete fields] \label{definition:real_and_complex_fields_as_complete_fields}
The \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:field}{field} \hl{$\mathbb{R}$} of \hldef{real numbers} is characterized (up to unique isomorphism) as the unique complete ordered field containing $\mathbb{Q}$ as a dense subfield.

The field $\mathbb{C}$ of complex numbers is the unique (up to unique isomorphism) algebraic closure of $\mathbb{R}$ of characteristic $0$ and is naturally a $2$-dimensional real vector space with the usual norm $|z| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ for $z = x + iy$.
With this norm, both $(\mathbb{R},|\cdot|)$ and $(\mathbb{C},|\cdot|)$ are complete normed fields.
