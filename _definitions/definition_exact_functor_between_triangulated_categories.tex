\begin{definition} \label{definition:exact_functor_between_triangulated_categories}
    A functor $T: D_1 \to D_2$ between triangulated categories is called \hldef{exact} if it is additive, is  translation preserving, and transforms distinguished triangles to distinguished triangles. Oftentimes, a \hldef{morphism between triangulated categories} refers to an exact functor between triangulated categories.
