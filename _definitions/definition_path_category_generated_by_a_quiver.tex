\begin{definition} \label{definition:path_category_generated_by_a_quiver}
Let $Q$ be a \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:quiver}{quiver}.
The \hldef{path category generated by $Q$}, denoted \hl{$\mathcal{F}(Q)$}, is the \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:category}{category} defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The objects of $\mathcal{F}(Q)$ are the vertices $Q_0$.
    \item For any two objects $x, y \in Q_0$, the set of morphisms $\text{Hom}_{\mathcal{F}(Q)}(x, y)$ consists of all paths from $x$ to $y$ --- A \hldef{path of length $n \ge 1$ from $x$ to $y$} is a sequence of arrows $\alpha_n \dots \alpha_1$ such that $s(\alpha_1) = x$, $t(\alpha_n) = y$, and $s(\alpha_{i+1}) = t(\alpha_i)$ for all $1 \le i < n$. Additionally, for each vertex $x$, there is a path $e_x$ of length $0$, which serves as the identity morphism.
    \item Composition of morphisms is defined by the concatenation of paths.
\end{itemize}
