\begin{definition} \label{definition:has_enough_points_for_a_topos}
A \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:topos}{topos} $\mathcal{E}$ is said to \hldef{have enough points} if the collection of all points of $\mathcal{E}$ is jointly faithful. 

Explicitly, this means that for any two distinct morphisms $f, g: X \to Y$ in $\mathcal{E}$, there exists a point $p: \mathbf{Set} \to \mathcal{E}$ such that the induced maps on stalks are distinct:
$$ p^*(f) \neq p^*(g). $$
Equivalently, a morphism $f$ in $\mathcal{E}$ is an isomorphism if and only if for every point $p$, the map $p^*(f)$ is an isomorphism of sets.
