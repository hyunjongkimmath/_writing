\TODO{TODO: read the following more carefully. Perhas this can be defined on a $C^k$-manifold.}
\begin{definition} \label{definition:Omega_k_M}
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold of dimension $n$, and let $k \in \mathbb{N}_0 \cup \{\infty\}$. 

The set \hldef{$\Omega^k(M)$}, called the \hldef{space of $k$-times continuously differentiable differential forms on $M$}, is defined as the collection of all differential forms on $M$ of class $C^k$. More precisely,
\[
\Omega^k(M) := \{ \omega \mid \omega \text{ is a differential form on } M \text{ such that for any chart }(U,\varphi), \ \omega|_U \text{ corresponds to a } C^k \text{ section of } \bigwedge T^*M \}.
\]

Here the differentiability class $C^k$ means that locally, in coordinates, the coefficient functions of the form $\omega$ are $k$-times continuously differentiable functions from open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ to the appropriate alternating tensor space.

Thus, $\Omega^k(M)$ generalizes the notion of smooth differential forms to those with finite regularity $k$.
\end{definition}
