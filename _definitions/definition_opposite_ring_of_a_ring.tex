\begin{definition}[Opposite ring] \label{definition:opposite_ring_of_a_ring}
Let $R = (R, +, \cdot, 0, 1)$ be a \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:ring}{ring} with addition $+$, multiplication $\cdot$, additive identity $0$, and multiplicative identity $1$ (not necessarily commutative).

The \hldef{opposite ring of $R$}, denoted $R^{\mathrm{op}}$, is the ring with the same underlying set $R$ and the same addition $+$ and additive identity $0$, but with multiplication defined by
$$ r \star s := s \cdot r $$
for all $r, s \in R$.

That is, multiplication in $R^\mathrm{op}$ is the multiplication of $R$ reversed in order.

If $R$ is \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:commutative_ring}{commutative}, then $R$ and $R^{\op}$ are naturally isomorphic to each other.
