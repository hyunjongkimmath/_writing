\begin{definition} \label{definition:codimension_of_an_irreducible_closed_subset_in_a_topological_space}
Let $X$ be a \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:topological_space}{topological space} and let $Y \subseteq X$ be an \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:irreducible_topological_space}{irreducible} closed subset. The \hldef{codimension of $Y$ in $X$}, denoted by \hl{$\operatorname{codim}(Y, X)$}, is the supremum of lengths of chains of irreducible closed subsets containing $Y$. That is, it is the supremum of integers $n$ such that there exists a chain
$$Y = Z_0 \subsetneq Z_1 \subsetneq \dots \subsetneq Z_n$$
where each $Z_i$ is an irreducible closed subset of $X$.
