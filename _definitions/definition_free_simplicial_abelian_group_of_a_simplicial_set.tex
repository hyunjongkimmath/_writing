\begin{definition} \label{definition:free_simplicial_abelian_group_of_a_simplicial_set}
    Let $X: \Deltaop \to \Sets$ be a simplicial set. The \hldef{free simplicial abelian group} \hl{$\bbZ[X]$} (which we may also denote by \hl{$\bbZ(X)$}) is the simplicial abelian group $\Deltaop \to \Ab$ given by sending $[n]$ to the free abelian group $\bbZ[X_n]$ generated by the set $X_n$; the morphisms $[n] \to [m]$ naturally induce morphisms $X_{m} \to X_{n}$ which in turn induce natural morphisms $\bbZ[X_{m}] \to \bbZ[X_{n}]$. Note that $\bbZ[X]$ is functorial in $X$.

    % Equivalently, the functor 
    % $$\bbZ[-]: \Deltaop \Sets = \Fun(\Deltaop, \Sets) \to \Fun(\Deltaop, \Ab) = \Deltaop \Ab$$
    % is given by
