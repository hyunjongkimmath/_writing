\begin{definition}[Complex Analytic Space]
A \hldef{complex analytic space} \((X, \mathcal{O}_X)\) is a locally ringed space over \(\mathbb{C}\) satisfying the following local model condition:

For every point \(x \in X\), there exists an open neighborhood \(U \subseteq X\), an integer \(n \geq 0\), 
and holomorphic functions \(f_1, \dots, f_k\) defined on an open subset \(\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{C}^n\), such that
\[
(U, \mathcal{O}_X|_U) \cong (V, \mathcal{O}_{\Omega}/\mathcal{I}),
\]
where
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(V \subseteq \Omega\) is the common zero locus
    \[
    V = \{ z \in \Omega \mid f_1(z) = \cdots = f_k(z) = 0 \},
    \]
    \item \(\mathcal{O}_{\Omega}\) is the sheaf of holomorphic functions on \(\Omega\),
    \item \(\mathcal{I} \subseteq \mathcal{O}_{\Omega}\) is the coherent sheaf of ideals generated by \(f_1, \dots, f_k\),
    \item The isomorphism is an isomorphism of locally ringed spaces.
\end{itemize}

In other words, a complex analytic space is a locally ringed space that is locally isomorphic to the zero locus of finitely many holomorphic functions in some \(\mathbb{C}^n\).

\smallskip

\hldef{Morphisms of complex analytic spaces} are defined to be morphisms of the underlying locally ringed spaces (also called \hldef{holomorphic maps}).
