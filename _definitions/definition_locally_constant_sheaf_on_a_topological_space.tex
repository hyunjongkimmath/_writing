\begin{definition}[Locally Constant Sheaf]
Let \( X \) be a topological space. A sheaf \( \mathcal{F} \) of abelian groups on \( X \) is said to be \hldef{locally constant} if it is locally constant with respect to the topological site associated to the topological space. In other words, $\mathcal{F}$ is locally constant if for every point \( x \in X \), there exists an open neighborhood \( U \subseteq X \) of \( x \) such that the restriction \( \mathcal{F}|_U \) is isomorphic to a constant sheaf on \( U \).

Accordingly, $\mathcal{F}$ is \hldef{of finite rank} if for each such open neighborhood \( U \), the constant sheaf \( \mathcal{F}|_U \) is isomorphic to the constant sheaf associated to a finite-dimensional vector space (or finitely generated free abelian group) over the base ring.
