\begin{definition} \label{definition:unit_upper_triangular_matrix_over_a_ring}
    Let $R$ be a ring. The group of $n \times n$ square matrices over $R$ that are upper triangular and whose diagonal entries are all $1$ is called the \hldef{unitriangular group} or the \hldef{group of unit upper triangular matrices}. It is often denoted by \hl{$U_n$}\footnote{Note that this notation can be confused for or conflicts with notation for the \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:unitary_group_over_a_scheme}{unitary group}.} or \hl{$UT_n$}.
