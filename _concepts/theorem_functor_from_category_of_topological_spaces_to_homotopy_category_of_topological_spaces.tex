\begin{theorem} \label{theorem:functor_from_category_of_topological_spaces_to_homotopy_category_of_topological_spaces}
There exists a canonical functor $Q: \text{Top} \to \text{hTop}$ which is the identity on objects and maps each continuous map $f$ to its homotopy class $[f]$. This functor is full and essentially surjective.
