\begin{proposition}[See {\cite[Expos\'e II Proposition 4.8]{SGA4_I}}] \label{proposition:category_of_sheaves_is_closed_under_finite_projective_limits_and_arbitrary_corpoducts}
    Let $\scrU$ be a universe and let $T$ be a $\scrU$-site. The category $\Shv(T)$ of sheaves on $T$ has the following properties:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\Shv(T)$ is closed under finite projective limits.
        \item $\Shv(T)$ is closed under arbitrary coproducts (indexed by $\scrU$-small set).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
