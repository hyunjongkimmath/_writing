\begin{theorem}[Examples of Henselizations and Strict Henselizations of Specific Local Rings] \label{theorem:examples_of_henselizations_and_strict_henselizations}
Let $p$ be a prime number
% and $K$ be a number field or a global function field with ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$. Consider the following examples of Henselizations and strict Henselizations:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The ring of integers localized at $p$, $\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$, has \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:henselization_of_a_local_ring}{Henselization} given by the $p$-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_p$. More precisely, 
    $$
    \mathbb{Z}_p \cong \text{Henselization of } \mathbb{Z}_{(p)}
    $$
    and is a complete discrete valuation ring that is Henselian.

    \item The \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:strict_henselization_of_a_local_ring}{strict Henselization} of $\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$ is the maximal unramified extension of $\mathbb{Z}_p$, obtained by adjoining all roots of unity of order prime to $p$. It is strictly Henselian and can be viewed as the ring of integers of the maximal unramified extension of the $p$-adic field $\mathbb{Q}_p$.
    
    % \item For a number field or global function field $K$ with ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$, let $\mathfrak{p}$ be a prime ideal of $\mathcal{O}_K$. The Henselization of the localization $(\mathcal{O}_K)_{\mathfrak{p}}$ is a Henselian local ring that algebraically approximates the completion $\widehat{(\mathcal{O}_K)_{\mathfrak{p}}}$, but need not be complete.
    
    % \item Its strict Henselization is obtained by extending scalars to a separable closure of the residue field at $\mathfrak{p}$ and then henselizing. This gives a strictly Henselian local ring associated to $(\mathcal{O}_K)_{\mathfrak{p}}$.
\end{enumerate}
% These examples illustrate the importance of Henselizations and strict Henselizations as algebraic substitutes of completions, capturing local algebraic properties crucial in arithmetic and algebraic geometry.
