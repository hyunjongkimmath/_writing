\begin{lemma} \label{lemma:examples_of_projective_and_injective_objects}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 
        Let $R$ be a \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:ring}{(not necessarily commutative) ring}.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item In the category $R\text{-}\mathbf{Mod}$ of left $R$-modules, projective objects are precisely direct summands of free modules.
            % \item In $R\text{-}\mathbf{Mod}$, injective objects are the ones satisfying Baer's criterion: $I$ is injective if and only if every $R$-linear map from a left ideal of $R$ to $I$ extends to $R$.
            \item For $R = \mathbb{Z}$, projective $\mathbb{Z}$-modules are the free abelian groups, and injective ones are the divisible abelian groups, e.g. $\mathbb{Q}$ or $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$.
        \end{enumerate}

        \item In the category $\mathbf{Set}$ of sets, every object is both projective and injective. Indeed, epimorphisms and monomorphisms in $\mathbf{Set}$ are surjective and injective maps, respectively, both of which split.
        \item In the category $\mathbf{Grp}$ of groups, projective objects are precisely the free groups, since every homomorphism from a free group lifts along surjective homomorphisms.
        \item In $\mathbf{Grp}$, the only injective object is the trivial group, since injectivity requires extensions along all inclusions, which only the terminal object satisfies.
    \end{enumerate}
