\begin{proposition} \label{proposition:homotopy_classes_of_maps_between_topological_spaces_are_preserved_by_composition}
Composition in the \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:homotopy_category_of_topological_spaces}{homotopy category of topological spaces} is well-defined. If $f_1, f_2: X \to Y$ are homotopic and $g_1, g_2: Y \to Z$ are homotopic, then the compositions $g_1 \circ f_1$ and $g_2 \circ f_2$ are homotopic as maps from $X$ to $Z$. That is, $[g] \circ [f] = [g \circ f]$ is independent of the choice of representatives.
