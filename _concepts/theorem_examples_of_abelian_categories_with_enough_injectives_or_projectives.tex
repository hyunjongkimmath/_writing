\begin{theorem} \label{theorem:examples_of_abelian_categories_with_enough_injectives_or_projectives}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Examples of abelian categories with enough injectives include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The category of abelian groups.
        \item The category of modules over a ring.
        \item The category of sheaves of abelian groups on a ringed space or on an essentially small site.
    \end{itemize}

    \item Examples of abelian categories with enough projectives include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The category of modules over a ring with enough projectives (e.g., rings with unity and suitable properties). \TODO{make this more precise}
        \item The category of finitely generated modules over a semisimple ring.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
% These conditions ensure the existence of derived functors such as Ext and Tor.
