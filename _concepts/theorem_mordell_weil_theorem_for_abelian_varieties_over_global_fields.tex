    Let $K$ be a \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:global_field}{global field}, and let $E$ be an \CrefAndHyperrefIfExist{definition:abelian_variety_over_a_field}{abelian variety} defined over $K$.  
    Then the group $E(K)$ of $K$-rational points on $E$ is a finitely generated abelian group; that is, there exist integers $r \geq 0$ and a finite abelian group $T$ such that
    $$E(K) \cong \mathbb{Z}^r \times T.$$
    Here, $r$ is called the \hldef{Mordell--Weil rank of $E$ over $K$} or the \hldef{algebraic rank of $E$ over $K$}, and $T$ is the torsion subgroup of $E(K)$.
