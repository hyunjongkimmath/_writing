Let $G$ be a connected affine \hyperrefIfExists{definition:algebraic_group_over_a_field}{algebraic group over an algebraically closed field}, and let $F: G \to G$ be an \hyperrefIfExists{definition:homomorphism_of_algebraic_groups_over_a_scheme}{endomorphism} that is surjective and has a finite number of fixed points. The Lang map associated to $F$ is surjective.
